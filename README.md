# Biostat625 Final Project
## Author: Cheukying (Rosita) Szeto, Salina Moon, Xiaochun Shao
## Title: Prevalence of Diabetes and Risk Factors: Longitudinal Analysis & Interactive Dashboard

Our Project consists of analysis of two dataset. 
Our primary dataset:

> SocialFactor

which concerning diabetes prevalence in relate to socaial determinants such as SVI, food insurity, and % of no health insurance. Our investigation includes initial files consolidation, a detailed exploratory analysis, Longitudinal Analysis using Linear Mixed Effect Model, and an Interactive Dashboard. 

Our secondary dataset:

> BioFactor

which concerning diabetes rate in relate to biological determinants such as obesity and inactivity. We consolidate the files and created some animated visuals to investigate the relationship. 

## Final Report

The final report summarizing our methods and results can be found in this repository, "Final Report.pdf."
